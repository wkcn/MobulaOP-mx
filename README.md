# MobulaOP-mx

MobulaOP-mx is an operator extend for MXNet.

It's flexible to build custom operators written by C++/C and CUDA without rebuilding MXNet.

## News

**Hi, all.**

**Thank you for watching this project :-)**

**I have merged the project into [MobulaOP](https://github.com/wkcn/MobulaOP).**

**MobulaOP has a better and simpler method to create custom operators by C++/C and CUDA without rebuilding source of the deep learning framework.**

**One code for each device, and one code for each deep learning framework.**

**MobulaOP will support more custom operators!**
